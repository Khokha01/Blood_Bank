# HOPE Application
Project overview   

We are building a system for HOPE mobile application at which we provide service to ease and fasten the operation of blood donation and it’s delivered to the patient who needs it. The goal of it is to connect between blood banks,donators, sponsors, hospitals, and patients.    

-When the system receives an order from a hospital or patient for a blood bag, 
it searches for the needed order in the nearest location to this hospital or 
patient.  

-If the system didn’t find the needed order in the nearest location, the system 
sends a message to the client for either choosing the system to ask the 
donators in his same region or searching for his request in far locations.  

-If the client chose to ask the donators in his same region, the system sends an 
urgent message with the location of the client to the donators (with the same 
blood type needed and didn’t donate for 4 months) in this region.  

-If the client chose to search for his request in far locations, the system would 
search in the other blood banks for the needed blood bag and send the a 
message to the client when his request is found.  

- The client will choose either to have the location where its request was found 
and bring the blood bag by himself or to deliver his request and pay freight 
cost.  

-Every time a donator donates with his blood through the application, the 
application gives him points which give benefits at our sponsors.
- Our sponsor sends us an advertisement request to which we reply with 
acceptance or refusal.
